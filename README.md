# Simple automatic differentiation library. 
diffco (differentiable <b>co</b>mputing) is created to explore variety of techniques for differentiating functions on R^n metric spaces. 
It might be augmented with neural networks implementation. Although, there are already great implementations maintained in quite mature level of technicality (JAX, DiffSharp, tinygrad).
